# Sortable, Filterable, Paginated Table

**Prompt**:

- Create React application that can render a table of data
- There's a fixed set of data in the public directory
- The table should render every field of data
- The application should be able to show an input in order to filter the table by matching the input string with any text in the data fields. This ideally should reduce the listed items in the table.
- The application should provide a field to select a field to sort by
- The application should provide another field to select whether we want to sort ascending or descending order
- The application should be able to paginate items by fixed number (6 items per page) and only that number of items should be displayed
- The application should provide control buttons to move through pages. Back and Next buttons should only enabled if is possible to navigate forward or backwards. It should also display the current page in the list.
